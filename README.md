# FDIC_rates


These days I've been changing a lot of banks and institutions since the rates have been changing a lot. AmEx was offering %3 APY two weeks ago as of writing to upping that APY to 3.30. But, what's the cap of APY? What's the max APY I can receive? Since that's regulated by FDIC, I decided to make a scraper for FDIC rates and made it a  web app using Streamlit. 

## Packages used:
beautifulsoup4, pandas,requests, streamlit
